- thoughts

  my big issue was that it was centrally located on a character, that one matter the obstecale had the immediate knowledge to hand so there was no stakes for me.
  
  I didn't like that in Season 2 they started giving background characters throw-away lines and suddenly that escalted to everyone loving each other
  
  Suru after always being suscpious and cold of Michael, suddenly loved her like a sister and then pretty much ignored his own sister then basically didn't seem to care about his real sister
  
  Spoke never mentioned a sister in TOS
  
  The tech is way beyond
  
  The defining piece of technology, while used well in the war is sketchy at best on how it works...the one place they could
  
  They are constantly shoe-horning references, while not taking the oppurtunity to make their own part of the Trek
  
  Everything is the fate of the galaxy, yet no-one really suffers consequences so actually they stakes are always low, so it just feels like high-budget over reacting
  
  So I decided to watch Season 3 and then thought no, I'm not enjoying this 
  
  Oh and how is Tilly captain? She might get there but promoting her past other offices, does not make sense to me.
  
  So I tried to watch Season 3 and then said I'll skip to the two parters, "is this a bad time to say I love you?" and I'm like no I don't like this show
  
  I might try and watch it all again, but I feel that there is no point. If you suffer through the dour backstory so it makes sense it won't be worth when eventually
  
  It's the constant crying and high state of love. It doesn't feel earned or written by commitee
  
  The previous treks, was an ensemble and characters would go off together or have their own episodes. This feels like a committee trying to hit quentians of quotas before over replying on high-budget production for storys and characters that don't land.
  
  The potential is here, the cast and crew know what they are doing, but I put this Star Trek in with recent Star Wars, that the writers and the producers leading the writers don't have the independence to tell a story and the producers are trying to "do something" with Trek and Wars (because they are huge and could define the success of CBS and Disney streaming platforms/revenue) that the writers get caught from, hey I got a great story
  
  The need to this show to be a success is what is holding it back and ultimately
  
  I don't really enjoy watching it and don't want to see another episode. I feel like I should but when it comes to watching the end of DS9 (which I'm holding back like a stash) and The Expanse there is simply no comparison
