Bruce Willis Reads Cue Cards
And it makes no sense

be aware **of the notes inTP**

The openly gay or just friend was perfect

The fight is more like a fast cut on a runway
The essense was the people doing those cool things, yeah they look cool to
Kurt Cobains hairy sweater
Nobody looks like there are fighting

I'm just waiting for the supporting character to get to the main characters

## It's madly steampunky

Plenket is making too many value statements, that I agree with but "show don't tell"

a Vent?....not a vent
I'm waiting for the sky beam

## Bot Bombs
so the zombie like swarm is interesting. But the tone of respecting and acknowleding a suicide survivor has valued and then plunge hundreds out of windows in the same manner of that suicide is fucking stupid

## small problems overhwhelm
they don't get how motorbikes work
The motorbike just isn't slow is expertly slow
it would actually be incredibly difficult to drive a motorbike that speed with two people on it.

and this is where the bullets have no meaning just because there is no avoidance

## interesting but un-used
- machine civil war
- machines going
- smith changing sides
but none of it explored
Trinity was a damsel in distress with no powers....expect as an ex-machina

If they don't fly and kill themselves  it will be weird
I'm very unclear on the rules of unplugging

## In Closing
Stress is wanting something now with time limited
Faith is knowing it will happen in time
Happy, Healthy, Occupied

## outro
the most excellent high-school band, only a mainstream arts education could sound this good but miss the point
Also the incident where she went to far
In contrast with the glossy inst star with a two-fer cooking show

## Not Action - visual story telling
That cut in the animax which makes you realise who talented
Advanced Action Film making through storytelling - bullet time is you move like them
