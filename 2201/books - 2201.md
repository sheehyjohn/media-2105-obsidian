## Hyperion
I struggle with giving a shit about the Shrike

## The Magician
I'm not really sure where to go with this
it's like I need a special occasion to finish it or something like that

## The Sunken Road
What a book
The jumping between time periods always felt lucid but not sure where I was or going 

On the second listen through it's absolutely magic

The art turn of phrase should be put into lyrics

## Enemy at the Gates
### William Craig
The Battle for Stalingrad
## Battle of St
being at the point of two empires crushing against each other
