## The Expanse

## The Animatrix

## The Tourist

## Curb Your Enthusiam
Dropped for making MeToo doubt and dismissal
It's not important if it doesn't bother me
Also not funny
I think Season 8 must have been an anomaly 

## Dexter - New Blood
Too many episodes and filler - especially E8's date

Strong finish, and sure at least we won't have to wait for another series :)
