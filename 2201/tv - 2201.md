## The Expanse
Always thought the billionaire space tourism is probably the most wrong and un-necessary thing in going on right now.

But then I saw a few photos of them filming the show against bluescreen, and thought surely your boss could sort you out....he has a spaceship. So in the idea of a production crew's employer, him having a spaceship, felt strange when he also pays 

But this again brings up the defination of what a vechile actually is. The Wright Brothers of accessible space flight. 


## The Tourist

## Curb Your Enthusiasm
Dropped for making MeToo doubt and dismissal
It's not important if it doesn't bother me
Also not funny
I think Season 8 must have been an anomaly 

## Dexter - New Blood
Too many episodes and filler - especially E8's date

Strong finish, and sure at least we won't have to wait for another series :)

## Family Guy
Watching Season 19

This is really a symptom of how truly sick I've been at the start of 2022

## Euphoria


## Dexter - New Blood 
A Good bit of filler (Episode 8's date)
But it stuck the landing in the end

Well at least we won't have to watch another season of Dexter :)

## Orville
March into May


## Boba Fett
Lazy, awkward and silly training montages
Going from here is a speeder to a train heist is just really silly 
Why Tosche Station....oh it's mentioned in the EpIV....wow
Staying restricted by the original trilogy rather than trying to tell a story.

The weekly episodes could be a factor


## Masters of the Universe

## Big City Greens

## Reservation Dogs
