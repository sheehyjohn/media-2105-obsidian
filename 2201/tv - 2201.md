## The Expanse
Always thought the billionaire space tourism is probably the most wrong and un-necessary thing in going on right now.

But then I saw a few photos of them filming the show against bluescreen, and thought surely your boss could sort you out....he has a spaceship. So in the idea of a production crew's employer, him having a spaceship, felt strange when he also pays 

But this again brings up the definition of what a vechile actually is. The Wright Brothers of accessible space flight. 

- Visual Exploration of book

the scale of the books just not possible to capture with this minimal season

TV show gets the concepts, but didn't have the 200 episodes it would need to have captured

 
## Family Guy
Watching Season 19

This is really a symptom of how truly sick I've been at the start of 2022

## Boba Fett
Lazy, awkward and silly training montages
Going from here is a speeder to a train heist is just really silly 
Why Tosche Station....oh it's mentioned in the EpIV....wow
Staying restricted by the original trilogy rather than trying to tell a story.

The weekly episodes could be a factor

## Curb Your Enthusiasm
Dropped for making MeToo doubt and dismissal
It's not important if it doesn't bother me
Also not funny
I think Season 8 must have been an anomaly 

## Sopranos
Parasite
Incapable of emotion
Nuture Nature - Regressive sociopath
No loss to society
Incapable of love - capable of entertainment
Garbage collector but actual human garbage
The fact he's intelligent enough
What sell lawn furniture?

## Dexter - New Blood 
A Good bit of filler (Episode 8's date)
But it stuck the landing in the end

Strong finish, and sure at least we won't have to wait for another series :)

Well at least we won't have to watch another season of Dexter :)

## The Tourist
Scorched beautiful 
Everyone
Clich√© but works characters into story

What looked like Probationary was about to become caught in bed with The Man she ended up making a historic murder report

6 months to live and a gun at your wife's head?

- episode 5
	- Going from being found to bed to making an international news worthy story of
	- Allowing LSD to let him stay alive and reverse the clice
	- The Subcious explaining is the brain resolving itself with facts
