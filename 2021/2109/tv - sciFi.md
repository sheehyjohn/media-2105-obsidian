It's actually getting better and almost compelling. The characters are in good places and relationships make sense. The Commonwealth has a nasty edge to it but The Fall explains that. It was obvious the dude was going in the bonfire but he is menacing and also definitely unhinged and while his motives are clich√©d (politicians not caring for soldiers) his team do have military ability and structure

Nut Bar...that's the way to frame and light a scene

## Rick and Morty
### season 5
ah sure at least they went back to some drama with the last episode

Season 2 and 3 are fantastic, but it eats it's own tail.
