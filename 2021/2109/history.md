So let's start


When we talk of the good IRA and he bad IRA we are relying on the fact that there is distance

For me it comes down to what type of United Ireland that you want

One where there is peace and prospetry for all 
or
One where the Unionists are treated

So while I don't have any issue, because how could I possible have with the politicial 

The Rangers, Pistols was unnecessary sectarism and attempted to raise money for a suicide prevention charity by disrespecting

It comes down to that the behaviour of the Unionist state was abhorant. But to sink to that level is the issue for me. For someone who hasn't been affected by the Troubles, in much the same way you wear a Celtic Jersey, you've never played for the team or experienced what it was like during the Troubles in Northern Ireland

## Again what Stuck me was the hiproacy
Trans Right are Human Rights
Fuck the Unionist Scum
