# Frankestein
## Chapter 1.....Letters really
Reflections and ambitions to sister
Noble friend
Ice sea adventures
His value as an officer
Hopefully and Enthusiastic 

### Washed up Revenger

## chapter 2 or is it 1
He got into these alcamy books
Dad dismissed him rather than valuing the person who
Which only lead him onto more

Excellent student after initially dismissing and definitely made it to postgraduate status

So it's the science fiction elements of mixing this alchemy of pre-science with this modern and professional science training....excellently grounds it within

The monster was supposed to be beautiful 

### Where is the education
Frank was happy when he ran away
but where did the education come form, just observing other people
Is he a person? Well definately not by any of there 

### Is evil inate? Frank is the evil one...
...and helpfully his brothers death means he'll never see that
The intention of action, and the releasing into the world without any supports or guidance


## this is your funeral!
What a dick thinking his experience is the final moment for all...this is die funeral

Oh and he immediately didn't inform the police or form a hunting party...a lynch mob if that's the correct use of the phrase

      No one can conceive the anguish I suffered 

That's a broad calculation of your emotions being superior or higher to others....others can't understand your depth of emotion....yeah because you caused it by your arrogance and lack of responsibility 

### depth of feeling
She is about to die but couldn't understand my anguish...dick head

## Volume2

OK so he is suicidal on the lake....but can't demolish his family....he is a very intense emotional person
